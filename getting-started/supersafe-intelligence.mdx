## Ensuring Safety

Ensuring patient safety is paramount in deploying voice-based clinical AI. Unlike text tools where clinicians review outputs before they reach patients, HANA speaks directly to patients in real-time. To uphold rigorous safety standards, we incorporate advanced methods that reduce errors, mitigate risks, and enhance reliability. Our dual-model architecture and constrained generation collectively improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and ensure well-calibrated, trustworthy outputs.

## Improved Calibration

Calibrated confidence refers to the alignment between the system's predicted confidence scores and its actual observed accuracy. A well-calibrated system provides confidence levels that clinicians can reliably interpret as true indicators of prediction correctness. Unlike models prone to overconfidence, especially at higher confidence intervals, a calibrated model avoids falsely reassuring clinical teams with unjustifiably high certainty.

Improved calibration directly supports safer and more informed clinical decisions, crucial in high-stakes scenarios where accurate confidence assessment helps prevent potential patient harm due to over-reliance on flawed outputs.

### How HANA Achieves Calibration

**Pre-Call Reasoning Engine:**
- Generates clinical question sets with associated confidence weights per question
- Each question tagged with expected information yield score
- Protocol branching decisions carry explicit confidence thresholds
- If confidence falls below threshold, system escalates to human review rather than guessing

**Real-Time Conversation Engine:**
- Monitors response quality against pre-computed expectations
- Tracks semantic alignment between patient responses and expected clinical patterns
- Flags unexpected responses for post-call clinical review
- Never improvises clinical guidance — falls back to approved protocol language

### Confidence Scoring

Scoring Dimensions:
- **Semantic Match (0.0–1.0)**: Does the patient response match the expected clinical entity?
- **Completeness (0.0–1.0)**: Did the patient provide all required information?
- **Consistency (0.0–1.0)**: Does the response contradict prior answers?

Composite Score = weighted_avg(semantic, completeness, consistency)

- IF composite < 0.7 → Re-ask with clarification
- IF composite < 0.4 → Flag for human follow-up
- IF composite < 0.2 → Graceful handoff to staff

### Calibration Validation

HANA validates calibration through continuous production monitoring:

- **Binned accuracy analysis**: Group predictions by confidence level and measure actual accuracy per bin
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: Track weighted average gap between predicted confidence and observed accuracy
- **Per-protocol calibration**: Each clinical protocol maintains its own calibration curve, updated with every completed conversation
- **Drift detection**: Automated alerts when calibration degrades beyond acceptable thresholds

## Reducing Hallucinations

By constraining the conversation engine to pre-approved response templates and grounding all entity references in verified data sources, HANA minimizes individual model biases and substantially reduces hallucinations.

### Anti-Hallucination Architecture

**Layer 1: Protocol Constraints**
- Only approved questions can be asked
- Only protocol-defined branches can be taken
- No freeform clinical advice generation

**Layer 2: Entity Grounding**
- All patient references grounded in EHR data
- Medication names validated against drug database
- Clinical terms mapped to SNOMED CT / ICD-10 ontologies

**Layer 3: Output Validation**
- Real-time semantic check against protocol
- Post-utterance verification before voice delivery
- Automated flagging of ungrounded statements

**Layer 4: Human Oversight**
- All conversations logged and auditable
- Flagged conversations reviewed within 24 hours
- Protocol updates triggered by error patterns

### Hallucination Monitoring

Metrics below are measured continuously across production conversations and updated as conversation volume grows. Current figures reflect internal evaluation across pilot deployments.

| Metric | Target | Observed |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Ungrounded clinical entity rate | < 0.1% | 0.03% |
| Protocol deviation rate | < 0.5% | 0.2% |
| Patient-reported misinformation | 0 | 0 |
| Automated safety flag rate | < 2% | 1.1% |

<Note>
These metrics are derived from automated evaluation pipelines (LLM-as-judge + rule-based validation) and clinical team review of flagged conversations. Methodology and sample details available upon request.

## Training Data Safety

To further ensure the safety and compliance of our clinical AI systems, we apply rigorous controls to the data used in training and evaluation.

### Data De-identification

- All real-world clinical data undergoes thorough de-identification, removing or obfuscating PII and PHI in accordance with HIPAA Safe Harbor and Expert Determination standards
- Re-identification risk assessment performed on each de-identified dataset
- Every de-identification operation logged with timestamp, method, and verification status

### Synthetic Data Generation

- Expert-designed clinical conversation templates covering common and edge-case scenarios
- Demographic diversity across age, gender, language, and cultural backgrounds to reduce model bias
- Complexity gradients from simple appointment confirmations to complex multi-condition medication reviews
- Adversarial examples with deliberately ambiguous patient responses for robust edge-case handling

### Scenario Coverage Without Risk

- By blending de-identified data with synthetic examples, we ensure high scenario diversity while eliminating risks of privacy breaches or data leakage
- Training data distributions monitored for demographic, geographic, and clinical condition balance
- All training data practices audited against HIPAA, GDPR, and SOC 2 Type II requirements
