## Research Origins

HANA's technology originated from a clinical research project analyzing voice patterns in bipolar disorder patients. The original work focused on detecting transitions between depressive and manic episodes through vocal biomarkers — pitch contour, speech rate variability, energy patterns, and pause dynamics. Key findings from this research informed HANA's vocal intelligence architecture:

- Voice-based features can detect mood state transitions before patients self-report changes
- Longitudinal tracking (baseline-deviation) significantly outperforms single-session emotion classification
- Prosodic features are more reliable than lexical sentiment for detecting clinical state changes
- Combining prosodic analysis with conversational content produces the strongest clinical signals

This work has since been extended to PTSD, chronic pain, palliative care, and geriatric populations — each with specific vocal patterns associated with clinical deterioration or improvement.

## Active Research

### Voice-Based Clinical Conversation Validation
- Ongoing study measuring clinical accuracy of AI-conducted patient conversations compared to human staff
- Evaluation across multiple clinical protocols: intake, chronic care management, behavioral health screening
- Metrics: information extraction accuracy, protocol compliance, patient satisfaction, clinical outcome correlation

### Vocal Biomarker Detection
- Longitudinal analysis of prosodic features as indicators of clinical state change across patient populations
- Baseline-deviation methodology validation across demographics, languages, and clinical conditions
- Integration of vocal intelligence with clinical conversation outcomes for predictive engagement models

### Deliberation Framework Validation
- Systematic evaluation of multi-model deliberation vs. single-model clinical reasoning for conversation planning
- Benchmarking against standard medical evaluation datasets
- Focus on calibration quality, hallucination reduction, and clinical safety margins

### Patient Engagement and Retention
- Longitudinal study tracking patient engagement metrics (completion rates, re-engagement, dropout rates) across voice AI vs. traditional outreach methods
- Analysis of health coaching and accountability companion features on program retention
- Multi-site study across primary care, behavioral health, and specialty organizations
- Measuring downstream clinical outcomes: no-show reduction, care gap closure, medication adherence

### Voice AI Safety in Healthcare
- Research into safety boundaries for autonomous voice-based patient interactions
- Escalation threshold optimization: when should AI defer to humans?
- Adversarial testing for rule-based safety agents, including compound risk signal detection
- Assessment of text-prosody discrepancy detection as a clinical safety signal

## Publications

Research publications will be made available as studies are completed and peer-reviewed. Current work is in preparation for submission to healthcare informatics and clinical AI journals.
