title: "Clinical Intake Agent"
description: "Structured clinical data collection for pre-visit intake, assessment administration, and CMS-billable documentation."
---

## Overview

The Clinical Intake Agent handles structured clinical data collection — the forms, screenings, and assessments that traditionally require paper, portals, or staff phone calls. It converts unstructured patient dialogue into structured clinical data flowing directly into the EHR.

## Use Cases

### Pre-Visit Intake
- Demographics and insurance verification
- Chief complaint and symptom collection
- Medical history update
- Current medication list reconciliation
- Allergy review
- Social history (smoking, alcohol, exercise)
- Family history updates

### Clinical Screening
- Validated assessment instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, AUDIT-C, CAGE-AID, ASQ-3, Edinburgh, KCCQ)
- Natural conversation administration rather than robotic question-reading
- Automatic clinical scoring with threshold-based alerts
- Results written directly to EHR as structured observations

### BHI/CCM Documentation
- Structured interactions designed to support CMS documentation requirements for billing codes
- Automated documentation for billing compliance review by clinical staff
- Time tracking for CMS time-based codes

<Note>
CMS billing eligibility for AI-conducted conversations depends on your organization's billing compliance framework and evolving CMS guidance. HANA generates the structured documentation and time tracking required for BHI/CCM billing submissions, but clinical teams should validate billing eligibility with their compliance department. We recommend consulting your billing compliance team during onboarding.
</Note>

### Post-Procedure Follow-Up
- Structured symptom collection after procedures
- Pain assessment and medication effectiveness
- Complication screening with escalation
- Recovery milestone tracking

## Structured Data Extraction

The agent converts unstructured patient dialogue into structured clinical data with entity extraction, verification against EHR data, and automatic follow-up question generation for ambiguous or incomplete information.

## Assessment Administration

HANA administers validated clinical assessments through natural conversation, mapping patient responses to scoring categories, calculating total scores, triggering clinical alerts, and documenting structured scores in the EHR.
