## Overview

HANA's voice engagement framework provides extensive customization capabilities to adapt to the specific needs of healthcare organizations, clinical specialties, and individual patients.

## Personalization Dimensions

### Organization-level Settings

- **Brand Alignment**: Customizable voice persona and greeting language to match healthcare organization's identity
- **Terminology Adaptation**: Support for organization-specific medical terminology and abbreviations
- **Workflow Integration**: Tailored insertion points within existing clinical processes (scheduling, intake, follow-up)
- **Security Controls**: Granular access management aligned with organizational policies
- **Operating Hours**: Configurable call scheduling, after-hours behavior, and retry policies

### Specialty-specific Customization

- **Specialty Protocols**: Pre-configured conversation templates for 20+ medical specialties
- **Condition-specific Content**: Tailored conversation flows for common conditions within each specialty
- **Assessment Instruments**: Specialty-appropriate screening tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7, AUDIT-C, CAGE-AID, etc.)
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Specialty-specific documentation requirements built into protocols
- **Billing Integration**: CPT/HCPCS code suggestions relevant to each specialty and conversation type

### Individual Patient Preferences

- **Language**: Primary language detection and preference storage; clinically validated for English, Spanish, Italian, French, and German with additional languages available at varying coverage levels
- **Communication Style**: Adjustable pacing, detail level, and formality based on patient profile
- **Contact Preferences**: Best time to call, preferred channel (voice, SMS), callback scheduling
- **Personal Templates**: Patient-specific conversation adjustments that persist across interactions
- **Learning Adaptation**: System adapts to individual communication patterns over time

## Personalization Infrastructure

### Longitudinal Memory Architecture

HANA builds a patient interaction profile that grows richer with every conversation. This is distinct from EHR data — the organization's clinical systems remain the source of truth for medical information. HANA's memory layer captures *interaction intelligence*: how to communicate with each patient most effectively.

**Memory Layers:**

| Layer | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Clinical context | EHR (pulled fresh before each call) | Diagnoses, medications, care plans, appointments |
| Communication preferences | Learned from interactions | Channel preference, best time to call, pacing, formality level |
| Conversation history | Built by HANA | Prior topics discussed, goals set, issues flagged |
| Behavioral patterns | Observed over time | Response style, engagement triggers, dropout risk signals |
| Vocal baseline | Vocal intelligence engine | Prosodic profile for longitudinal deviation detection |

**How Memory Improves Conversations:**
- A patient who prefers texts over calls gets SMS outreach first
- A patient with lower health literacy gets simpler language and more confirmation checks
- A chronic care patient's third monthly check-in references what was discussed in the first two
- A patient who expressed frustration about insurance in a prior call gets a more empathetic tone when the topic comes up again

### Patient Profile Management

- **Preference Persistence**: Secure storage of patient settings across conversations and channels
- **Role-based Defaults**: Initial settings based on clinical protocol and patient demographics
- **Preference Portability**: Settings follow patients across departments, locations, and provider changes
- **Version Compatibility**: Patient preferences maintained through system updates

### Personalization Workflow

- **Guided Setup**: Interactive onboarding for initial organization and protocol personalization
- **Continuous Refinement**: Ongoing opportunities to adjust preferences based on conversation outcomes
- **Clinician Input Integration**: Clinical staff can annotate patient profiles with notes about communication preferences, sensitivities, or context that enriches future conversations — similar to how care teams pass notes between shifts
- **Preference Analytics**: Insights into which personalization options improve engagement and completion rates
- **Protocol Sharing**: Ability to share effective protocol configurations within organizations

### Technical Implementation

- **Efficient Caching**: Local caching of personalization settings for fast conversation initialization
- **Synced Preferences**: Real-time synchronization across channels (voice, SMS) and sessions
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful defaults when personalization data is unavailable
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal impact on conversation response latency regardless of personalization level
- **Privacy Compliance**: All preference data encrypted, auditable, and deletable per patient request
- **Data Ownership**: Patient interaction data belongs to the healthcare organization. HANA processes and stores it per the organization's retention policies and provides full export capability.
