## Overview

HANA's Self-correcting Models represent an advanced framework for autonomous error detection, correction, and continuous improvement in clinical voice AI. Built on our service architecture, these models employ multi-layered validation, real-time feedback loops, and adaptive learning mechanisms to achieve high reliability and accuracy in production environments.

The system combines constrained generation, reference-free evaluation, and continuous optimization to create conversations that not only detect errors but actively improve performance over time.

## Core Self-Correction Architecture

### Multi-Layered Validation System

**Immediate Validation (per-utterance):**
- Template compliance checking for response format and content
- Entity grounding verification against patient EHR data
- Confidence scoring based on model internal states
- Real-time safety filtering for clinically inappropriate content

**Turn-Level Validation (between turns):**
- Semantic consistency analysis across conversation turns
- Cross-reference validation against known patient data and protocol constraints
- Context coherence checking for multi-turn clinical dialogues
- Domain-specific rule validation (e.g., medication names, ICD codes, assessment scoring)

**Post-Call Validation (async):**
- Comprehensive clinical accuracy verification using LLM-as-judge evaluation
- Full transcript analysis for protocol compliance
- Long-term context validation across patient's conversation history
- Quality assurance against evaluation datasets and clinical standards

### Candidate Verification Framework

**Generation and Verification Pipeline:**
- Conversation engine generates candidate responses for each turn
- Reasoning engine evaluates and ranks candidates against protocol constraints, selecting the optimal response
- Verification is optimized for minimal latency impact on the conversation flow
- Self-calibration adjusts correction thresholds based on conversation context and historical accuracy

**Correction Strategies:**
- Immediate corrections for detected errors during response generation (block and regenerate)
- Mid-conversation corrections through clarification and re-asking (soft redirect)
- Post-conversation corrections flagged for clinical team review
- Predictive corrections based on known error patterns in similar conversations

### Continuous Learning Mechanisms

**Feedback Loop Architecture:**
- Real-time correction logging for pattern identification across production conversations
- Error taxonomy classification for systematic improvement
- Performance regression detection and automatic rollback for model updates
- A/B testing framework for correction strategy optimization

**Data-Driven Optimization:**
- Error pattern mining from production conversations
- Correction effectiveness analysis across different clinical protocols
- Model weight adjustments based on correction success rates
- Dynamic threshold tuning for optimal precision-recall balance

## Self-Correction Implementation

### Implementation Architecture

**Real-Time Correction Pipeline:**

Stream Processing:
- Immediate error detection during response generation
- Context-aware correction maintaining natural conversation flow
- Memory-efficient correction processing per active session
- Concurrent correction across all active conversation sessions

Correction Decision Engine:
- Multi-factor scoring combining confidence, context, and historical data
- Threshold-based correction triggering with adaptive boundaries
- Cost-benefit analysis for correction implementation (is re-asking worth the disruption?)
- Patient experience optimization minimizing correction-related conversation friction

### Batch Correction Framework

**Historical Data Processing:**
- Retroactive quality analysis for completed conversations
- Large-scale pattern identification across conversation corpus
- Data migration support during model updates
- Quality metric recalculation after protocol changes

**Performance Optimization:**
- Parallel analysis processing across multiple compute nodes
- Checkpoint-based recovery for long-running analysis jobs
- Resource scheduling to minimize impact on live conversation services
- Progress tracking and reporting for operational visibility

### Error Detection Mechanisms

**Statistical Anomaly Detection:**

Confidence Score Analysis:
- Low confidence detection using model uncertainty quantification
- Confidence calibration ensuring scores reflect actual accuracy
- Ensemble disagreement as indicator of potential errors
- Temporal consistency checking across related outputs

Pattern Recognition:
- Known error pattern matching using curated clinical error databases
- Linguistic anomaly detection for unnatural conversation patterns
- Factual inconsistency detection using patient data validation
- Reasoning chain verification for multi-step clinical logic

**Domain-Specific Validation:**

Clinical Domain:
- Medication name validation against pharmaceutical databases
- Drug interaction checking when multiple medications discussed
- Medical terminology verification against authoritative sources (SNOMED CT, RxNorm)
- Clinical guideline compliance checking for protocol-defined recommendations

Assessment Instruments:
- PHQ-9, GAD-7, AUDIT-C scoring validation against administration rules
- Threshold-based alert verification for screening instrument results
- Response mapping validation (patient language → assessment score category)

### Correction Strategies

**Immediate Correction Approaches:**

Response-Level Correction:
- Real-time response replacement during generation when safety or grounding check fails
- Alternative phrasing generation for unclear or ambiguous utterances
- Template fallback for responses that fail multiple validation checks
- Graceful acknowledgment when system cannot generate a valid response

Conversation-Level Correction:
- Soft redirect: naturally steer conversation back on track without calling attention to the correction
- Explicit clarification: directly address ambiguity or inconsistency with the patient
- Graceful deferral: hand off to human staff when system cannot resolve the issue

**Retrospective Correction Methods:**

Post-Call Analysis:
- Targeted error identification for specific clinical data extraction issues
- Comprehensive quality assessment for entire conversation transcripts
- Pattern identification across conversations for systematic protocol improvements
- Clinical team notification for conversations requiring human review

Learning Integration:
- Protocol updates based on recurring error patterns
- Template expansion incorporating correction insights
- Training data augmentation with corrected conversation examples
- Evaluation metric refinement based on correction effectiveness
