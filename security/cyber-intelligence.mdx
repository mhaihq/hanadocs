## Overview

HANA maintains enterprise-grade security standards with comprehensive compliance certifications, including SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and GDPR. Our platform leverages cloud infrastructure to provide robust encryption, secure communications, and continuous monitoring, ensuring optimal data protection for healthcare customers.

### Compliance Certifications

| Certification | Status | Coverage | Scope |
|--------------|--------|----------|-------|
| SOC 2 Type II | ✅ Audited controls for security, availability, and confidentiality | Complete annual cycle audit | Comprehensive evaluation of trust service principles |
| HIPAA | ✅ Continuously monitored | US healthcare data privacy regulations | Essential for healthcare providers, insurers, and medical technology |
| GDPR | ✅ Continuously monitored | EU personal data protection and privacy | Global compliance for handling EU citizen data with privacy-by-design architecture |

## Security Architecture

### Multi-layered Defense Strategy

Our cyber-intelligence framework implements multiple layers of defense to ensure comprehensive protection:

1. **Perimeter Security**: Advanced threat detection at network boundaries using intrusion detection/prevention systems
2. **Infrastructure Security**: Hardened cloud infrastructure with restricted access controls
3. **Application Security**: Secure development practices with regular code audits and vulnerability assessments
4. **Data Security**: End-to-end encryption with sophisticated key management
5. **Operational Security**: Continuous monitoring with real-time alerts and automated remediation

### Data Encryption

All data within the HANA platform is protected using industry-leading encryption standards:

- **Storage Encryption**: AES-256 with cloud-managed encryption keys
- **Communication Encryption**: TLS 1.3 enforced for all traffic
- **Key Management**: Cloud KMS integration with strict access controls
- **PHI Protection**: Special handling for protected health information with additional encryption layers

### Network Security

- **Protocol Security**: HTTPS enforced across all endpoints
- **SSL Configuration**: Comprehensive SSL certificate deployment
- **Traffic Protection**: End-to-end encrypted communications
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, token-based authentication, and request validation

### Service Architecture Integration

HANA's cyber-intelligence capabilities are deeply integrated with our service architecture:

1. **Service Mesh Security**: Secure service-to-service communication with mutual TLS
2. **Zero Trust Implementation**: Verification of every request regardless of source
3. **Centralized Policy Enforcement**: Consistent security policies across all services
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for security events

## AI-Specific Security Controls

### Model Safety Mechanisms

HANA implements specialized security controls for AI components:

1. **Input Sanitization**: Advanced filtering to prevent prompt injection and other attacks on conversation engine
2. **Output Monitoring**: Automated content scanning for sensitive information leakage in voice responses
3. **Runtime Isolation**: Containerized execution environments for model inference
4. **Model Versioning**: Strict version control with cryptographic verification for all model artifacts
5. **AI Vulnerability Management**: Dedicated monitoring for AI-specific threats

### LLM Safety Framework

- **Jailbreak Prevention**: Constrained generation architecture prevents conversation engine from operating outside protocol boundaries
- **Continuous Validation**: Automated testing against known attack vectors for voice AI systems
- **Red Team Exercises**: Regular adversarial testing focused on clinical AI vulnerabilities
- **Content Filtering**: Multi-stage filtering for harmful or clinically inappropriate outputs

## Security Controls Framework

HANA maintains a comprehensive security controls framework across multiple domains:

**Access Control & Authorization (30+ Controls)**
- Comprehensive access control procedures
- Infrastructure modification restrictions
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Role-based access control with least privilege principles

**Data Privacy & Security (60+ Controls)**
- Comprehensive data protection procedures
- Anonymization and pseudonymization processes
- Data retention and disposal policies
- Secure data transfer mechanisms

**Risk & Incident Management (30+ Controls)**
- Incident response procedures
- Risk assessment frameworks
- Vendor risk management
- Business continuity planning

**IT & Operational Security (25+ Controls)**
- Application monitoring and alerting
- Asset management procedures
- Disaster recovery planning
- Change management processes

## EU AI Act Compliance

The European Union's AI Act classifies AI systems that affect access to healthcare as **high-risk applications**. This includes AI systems involved in patient triage, clinical decision support, prior authorization, and any scenario where an AI output could influence a patient's access to care.

### Current Status

HANA is actively working toward full EU AI Act compliance for healthcare deployments in Europe:

- **Risk classification assessment**: Mapping HANA's capabilities against the AI Act's high-risk categories to determine registration requirements per use case
- **Conformity assessment preparation**: Documenting technical architecture, safety measures, and quality management systems required for high-risk AI registration
- **EU database registration**: Preparing for registration in the EU database of high-risk AI systems as required before production deployment with EU patients

### Use Case-Specific Classification

Not all HANA deployments carry the same regulatory classification under the AI Act:

| Use Case | AI Act Classification | Registration Required |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Appointment reminders, scheduling | Lower risk | No |
| Pre-operative preparation follow-up | Lower risk | No |
| Clinical screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7) | Potentially high risk | Under assessment |
| Prior authorization / insurance verification | High risk | Yes |
| Clinical decision support influencing care access | High risk | Yes |

### What This Means for EU Customers

- **Non-high-risk use cases** (appointment management, preparation reminders, general outreach) can proceed under standard GDPR compliance
- **High-risk use cases** (anything involving clinical decisions that affect care access) require HANA to be registered in the EU AI Act database before production deployment — including POC/pilot phases with live patients
- HANA works with EU customers during scoping to classify the intended use case and determine the regulatory pathway

<Note>
For EU healthcare organizations evaluating HANA: we recommend discussing your intended use case during the scoping phase so we can provide a clear regulatory timeline. Some use cases can proceed immediately; others require registration that we are actively pursuing.
