## Overview

On-premises infrastructure plays a critical role in enhancing safety for healthcare applications by ensuring that sensitive patient data remains within the provider's secure environment. By reducing reliance on external cloud services, on-premises deployments minimize potential exposure to third-party breaches and enable tighter access control. This localized, encrypted setup supports compliance with healthcare regulations and gives organizations full authority over data handling, retention, and auditability.

### Data Residency & Compliance

- On-premises deployments ensure PHI and sensitive health data never leave the provider's infrastructure, supporting strict compliance with HIPAA and region-specific regulations
- Conversation recordings, transcripts, and extracted clinical data stored entirely within the organization's data center
- Supports healthcare organizations with strict data sovereignty requirements that prohibit cloud-based PHI processing

### Isolated Model Hosting

- Self-hosted AI models and inference systems run within provider-controlled environments, eliminating third-party cloud exposure and reducing attack surfaces
- Conversation engine and reasoning engine deployed on organization-managed hardware
- Voice processing (speech recognition and synthesis) can run locally for complete data isolation
- Supports encrypted inference for secure data processing during model execution

<Note>
On-premises deployment requires dedicated infrastructure provisioning. The reasoning engine requires GPU-equipped servers (minimum specifications provided during scoping). Voice processing adds additional compute requirements. HANA provides a detailed hardware requirements guide and works with your IT team to validate infrastructure readiness before deployment. Typical on-premises deployments take 6-10 weeks including infrastructure setup, compared to 2-4 weeks for cloud deployments.

### Operational Control & Auditability

- Providers retain full control over data access, retention, and key management, with the ability to define deletion schedules or revoke access instantly
- All infrastructure is auditable and designed to meet healthcare-grade standards for system integrity, access logging, and redundancy
- Organization's IT team manages updates, patches, and security configurations on their own schedule
- Complete visibility into all data flows and processing operations

## On-Premises Architecture

**Deployment Components:**
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes) running on organization-managed servers
- GPU nodes for reasoning engine inference (HANA provides minimum hardware specifications; organizations may need to provision dedicated GPU infrastructure)
- CPU nodes for real-time conversation engine
- Local telephony integration with organization's existing phone system (SIP trunking)
- Local database and storage for all conversation data

**Network Configuration:**
- No outbound data transmission of PHI — all processing happens locally
- Optional secure tunnel for model updates and system patches (no patient data transmitted)
- Integration with organization's existing network security infrastructure
- Compatible with organization's VPN and firewall configurations

**Hybrid Options (recommended for most on-prem customers):**
- On-premises data processing with cloud-based model updates (no PHI leaves premises) — most common configuration
- Conversation execution on-premises with anonymized analytics sent to cloud for quality monitoring
- Full air-gapped deployment for maximum isolation — requires additional infrastructure planning and limits model update frequency
